## Project
A simple beginner Python project that takes user input to generate a fun band name using their city and pet name.

---

## The Challenge
- Ask the user for the city they grew up in.
- Ask the user for their petâ€™s name.
- Combine them to create a "band name".

---

## My Process
- Focused on learning the `input()` function and string concatenation.
- Tried a few variations with f-strings and `.title()` for cleaner formatting.
- Used `print("\n")` to add spacing for better user experience.
